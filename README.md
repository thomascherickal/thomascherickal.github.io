# Project Portfolio

This repo contains eight of my projects ranging from machine learning to deep learning to quantum computing and even blockchain. And yes - in some places the coding was assisted by AI.

 1. Raw Sonar Data Mines vs. Rocks Classification By Various Models of Scikit-Learn, A Classification Comparison.
 2. Same Dataset, but this time, classified using Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras.
 3. Demonstration of Shor's Algorithm implemented for 4 bits using Flutter and Dart.
 4. Cross-Platform CRUD application that works on all Platforms built using F# and Avalonia FuncUI with Fable
 5. MNIST classification problem efficiently solved using the Julia Programming Language
 6. Using the Quantum ML Variational Eigensolver Algorithm to Solve an Optimization Problem in IBM Qiskit
 7. Using three different blockchain systems to implement a smart contract that sells an Audio file NFT in Rust
 8. Efficient Mining of Bitcoin using Golang's coroutines for high-performance computing.
