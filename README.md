# Project Portfolio

This repo contains four of my projects ranging from machine learning to deep learning to quantum computing (WIP).

 1. [Raw Sonar Data Mines vs. Rocks Classification By Various Models of Scikit-Learn, A Classification Comparison.](https://github.com/thomascherickal/thomascherickal.github.io/tree/master/Sonar-Classification-Comparison-with-Scikit-Learn)
 2. [Same Dataset, but this time, classified using Deep Learning with TensorFlow.](https://github.com/thomascherickal/thomascherickal.github.io/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Sonar-with-TensorFlow)
 3. [MNIST Dataset classified using Deep Learning in Keras.](https://github.com/thomascherickal/thomascherickal.github.io/tree/master/Deep-Learning-MNIST-with-Keras)
 4. [MNIST classification problem efficiently solved in the Python Programming Language.](https://github.com/thomascherickal/thomascherickal.github.io/tree/master/MNIST-Python)
