# Project Portfolio

This repo contains eight of my projects ranging from machine learning to deep learning to quantum computing and even blockchain. And yes - in some places the coding was assisted by AI.

 1. [Raw Sonar Data Mines vs. Rocks Classification By Various Models of Scikit-Learn, A Classification Comparison.](https://github.com/thomascherickal/thomascherickal.github.io/tree/master/Sonar-Classification-Comparison-with-Scikit-Learn)
 2.[Same Dataset, but this time, classified using Deep Learning with TensorFlow.](https://github.com/thomascherickal/thomascherickal.github.io/tree/master/Deep-Learning-Sonar-with-TensorFlow)
 3. [MNIST Dataset classified using Deep Learning in Keras.](https://github.com/thomascherickal/thomascherickal.github.io/tree/master/Deep-Learning-MNIST-with-Keras)
 3. [Demonstration of Shor's Algorithm implemented for 4 bits using Flutter and Dart.](https://medium.com/quantum-ai/demonstrating-how-shors-algorithm-cracks-the-rsa-encryption-standard-poc-4-bit-version-b8cc9a62c06a)
 4. [MNIST classification problem efficiently solved in the Python Programming Language.](https://github.com/thomascherickal/thomascherickal.github.io/tree/master/MNIST-Python)     
 5. [MNIST classification problem efficiently solved using the Julia Programming Language](https://github.com/thomascherickal/thomascherickal.github.io/tree/master/MNIST-Julia)
 7. Using three different blockchain systems to implement a smart contract that sells an Audio file NFT in Rust (WIP)
